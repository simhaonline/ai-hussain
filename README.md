Prepare full Python script for AI Conversational PDF Processing System, An end-to-end AI solution that can extract and understand content from PDF documents (including both text-based PDFs and scanned images within PDFs) and enable a conversational AI model to engage in human-like dialogue about the content. In essence, the system will ingest PDFs, Embed the pdfs with the embedding model BGE-M3, perform text extraction (with OCR for scanned pages), preprocess and analyze the text, engineer relevant features, and train a sophisticated NLP model capable of various tasks (e.g. document classification, summarization, Q&A), store the vectors in vector DB. 
The ultimate objective is to fine-tune this model for natural, context-aware conversation, and deploy it as a real-time service (accessible via an API) that can interact with users in a dialogue format about the PDF content. 
Generate full RAG using above methodology, make multiple python script for easy troubulshooting

### Key Components of the System
---
PDFProcessor: Handles extraction of text from PDFs
- Processes both text-based PDFs and scanned images using PyMuPDF and Tesseract OCR
- Provides text preprocessing capabilities
---
TextAnalyzer: Analyzes and processes text content
- Segments documents into manageable chunks
- Extracts linguistic and semantic features
- Generates embeddings using a selected model (e.g., InstructorXL, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, OpenAI ADA, or BGE)
- Supports embedding pipeline for both real-time and batch processing
- Extracts keywords
---
ModelManager: Manages various NLP models
- Question-answering capabilities
- Text summarization
- Document classification
- Conversational responses
- Supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging embeddings + vector search + LLM inference
- Supports LLM hosting via vLLM for scalable, high-performance transformer inference (e.g., mistral, llama3, or custom fine-tuned models)
---
DocumentStore: Manages storage and retrieval of documents
- Stores processed documents with metadata
- Stores and indexes document embeddings using FAISS, Qdrant, or Milvus
- Enables semantic search across documents
- Maintains document embeddings for retrieval
---
ConversationalAPI: Provides RESTful endpoints
- Document upload and processing
- Document listing and retrieval
- Conversational interactions with documents
- Document search functionality
- Chat endpoint powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fetching relevant chunks via embedding search and passing context to LLM
- Streaming LLM responses if vLLM is configured with OpenAI-compatible API
